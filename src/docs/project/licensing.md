# Licensing

## Disclaimer

"Open source" is a term managed by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). The foundation laid
out [rules](https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines/) for what qualifies as open-source. Unfortunately, open source
isn't applicable to Convoy, and having our code public on GitHub doesn't mean we're open source but source available. We
ask everybody to refrain from referring Convoy as open-source because it's misleading.
