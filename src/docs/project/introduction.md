# Introduction

Convoy is a traditional server management platform for interacting with Proxmox-based virtual machines. Built with Laravel, React, and Rust, Convoy runs fast under the hood while exposing a beautiful and modern UI to administrators and users.

## Disclaimers

Convoy isn't a drop-in replacement for Proxmox. Instead, it automates common functions in an intuitive user interface that's tailored to hosting companies. Advanced virtual machine configuration must be done through the Proxmox virtual environment web interface.


Additonally, container-based servers are out of our scope because of our heavy focus on KVM server management.
