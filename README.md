# Convoy documentation

## Contributing

This site is built with [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and depends
on [@vue/theme](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-theme). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. For
simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, [npm](https://npmjs.com/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as
optional chaining.

## Working on the content

- See VitePress docs on supported [Markdown Extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown) and the ability
  to [use Vue syntax inside markdown](https://vitepress.dev/guide/using-vue).

- See the [Writing Guide](https://github.com/convoypanel/documentation/blob/master/.github/contributing/guidelines.md)
  for our rules and recommendations on writing and maintaining documentation content.
